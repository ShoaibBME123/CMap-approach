# CMap-approach
The detailed statistical method for comparing predicted gene expression signature (Citalopram remission) and antidepressants profiles from connectivity map database can be found in my published article,
Shoaib, M., Giacopuzzi, E., Pain, O. et al. Investigating an in silico approach for prioritizing antidepressant drug prescription based on drug-induced expression profiles and predicted gene expression. Pharmacogenomics J 21, 85â€“93 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41397-020-00186-5
We implemented an in-silico methods based on GWAS, TWAS and Cmap approach useful in precesion psychiary and pharmacogenomics
